# Twitter List Reader

This application will load the Twitter accounts found on the iOS device and allow a user to have lists they subscribe to show up in a timeline view. Selected lists are saved across sessions.

This was my first attempt at writing a (mostly) fully functioning and featured iOS application. Changes and pull requests accepted.
